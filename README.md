# google-drive-ops
This repository is intended to build common file operations I need to interact with Google Drive that is not available via their UI. 

## State of the project
At this point, I've created this repository to begin recording my thoughts on the need.

## Motivation
I have found the Google Drive UI to be lacking common file operations I need in how I am using the service, including:
- Easy file list export
- Summarization of file sizes
- Text-based file listing
- Counting files in directories (without needing to "select all") and subdirectories

## List of operations
This is a (not yet comprehensive) list of specific operations I would like to have built out.

Given a directory location:
- List all files in the directory
- Count number of folders and files in the directory
- Sum the total size of all items in the directory

## Helpful references
These are references I find helpful while researching how to build these file operations:
